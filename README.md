# Legacy-Models

## Purpose

The purpose of the Legacy-Models project is to preserve and showcase the foundational models in the field of machine learning and deep learning. By providing implementations and detailed analyses of these legacy models, I aim to:

- Educate new generations of researchers and practitioners about the historical context and development of machine learning models.
- Offer a comprehensive resource for understanding the evolution of model architectures and techniques.
- Facilitate comparative studies and benchmarking against modern models to highlight advancements and areas for further research.
- Promote the appreciation of the pioneering work that has laid the groundwork for current and future innovations in the field.

I am also on a learning journey and welcome collaboration and shared learning experiences with the community. Through this project, I hope to contribute to the ongoing education and inspiration of the machine learning community.
